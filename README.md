https://travis-ci.org/neerajjain92/spring-boot-playground.svg?branch=master

  1) CRUD operation for  Drowned Ships.
  2) Using Flyway for Database migration
  3) Using In memory H2 database for persistence.
  
# Testing the Application
This example includes 3 types of test
  1) Unit Test with Mocked Services using Mockito dependency (ShipwreckControllerTest)
  2) Integration Test for the Services (ShipwreckRepositoryIntegrationTest)
  3) Web Integration Test for actually testing WebServices (ShipwreckControllerWebIntegrationTest)
  
It's nice and easy example to get your hands dirty on Spring Boot and other useful dependency.
